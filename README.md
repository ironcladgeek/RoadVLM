# RoadVLM 🚗 🧠

## Overview
RoadVLM is an experimental system that demonstrates how vision-language models (VLMs) can be used to understand driving scenarios and make intuitive decisions. By processing images from a front-facing camera, RoadVLM predicts the most reasonable driving actions while providing clear visual explanations of its decision-making process.

## Key Features
- 🎯 Real-time driving action prediction
- 🔍 Scene understanding and object detection
- 📊 Confidence scoring for predictions
- 🖼️ Visual explanation generation
- 🚦 Traffic element recognition

## Architecture
- Built on Ollama for local inference
- Optimized for Apple Silicon (M2)
- Pure Python implementation
- Modular and extensible design
